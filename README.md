# Overview

Import volumes in `NRRD` format with masks in `NRRD` format with semantic segmentation labels.

# How to Run

The App can be launched from the Ecosystem, Team Files, or Agent.

<details>
<summary open>Run from team files</summary>
<br>

1. Run the application from the context menu of the folder (right mouse button) on the Team Files page

2. Fill in the project name in the `Result Project Name` field or leave the default value.
3. If you want to leave your folder in Team Files after successful import, uncheck the box `Remove temporary files after successful import` below.
4. Also, you can set `Advanced settings` such as agent, app version, and others.
5. Click the `Run` button to start the App.

3. If you want to use a project from Team Files, choose the `Team Files` option and choose a folder to use in the app.

<summary>Run from agent</summary>

The application supports import from a special directory on your local computer. It is made for Enterprise Edition customers who need to upload tens or even hundreds of gigabytes of data without using the drag-and-drop mechanism:

1. Run an agent on your computer where data is stored. Watch the [how-to video](https://youtu.be/aO7Zc4kTrVg).
2. Copy your data to the special folder on your computer that was created by the agent. Agent mounts this directory to your Supervisely instance and it becomes accessible in Team Files. Learn more in the [documentation](https://github.com/supervisely/docs/blob/master/customization/agents/agent-storage/agent-storage.md). Watch the [how-to video](https://youtu.be/63Kc8Xq9H0U).
3. Go to `Team Files` -> `Supervisely Agent` and find your folder there.
4. Right-click to open the context menu and start the App. Now the App will upload data directly from your computer to the platform.

# Input Data Structure

The Project name will not be taken from the root folder name. You should specify the project name in the modal window when you run the App.

Project directory example:

```
ðŸ“‚my_volumes_project
â”œâ”€â”€ðŸ“œclass2idx.json (optional)
â”œâ”€â”€ðŸ“‚dataset_01
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ðŸ“‚volume
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ðŸ“œvolume_1.nrrd
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ðŸ“œvolume_2.nrrd
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ðŸ“œ...
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ðŸ“‚mask
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ðŸ“‚volume_1.nrrd
â”‚       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ðŸ“œmask_1.nrrd
â”‚       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ðŸ“œmask_2.nrrd
â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ðŸ“œ...
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ðŸ“‚volume_2.nrrd
â”‚       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ðŸ“œmask_1.nrrd
â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ðŸ“œ...
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ ...    
â”œâ”€â”€ðŸ“‚dataset_02
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ðŸ“‚volume
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ðŸ“œvolume_1.nrrd
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ðŸ“œ...
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ðŸ“‚mask
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ðŸ“‚volume_1.nrrd
â”‚       â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ðŸ“œmask_1.nrrd
â”‚       â”‚   â””â”€â”€ðŸ“œ...
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ðŸ“‚...    
â””â”€â”€ðŸ“‚...
```
`class2idx.json` is an optional JSON file containing dictionary `{ "class_name" (str): index (int) }`
where indexes start from `1` and increment accordingly the number of masks. If the number of classes is less than the number of masks, classes with the names like `class_2` will be created automatically for every mask. 
If you don't provide this file, class names will be created automatically (`class1`, `class2`, ...).

Each Mask file of each Volume can contain only one object.

Ð¡lasses in JSON must be written in the same order as the masks are sorted by name inside the directory.

`class2idx.json` example:
```
{
	"dataset_01_volume_1_mask_1": 1,
	"dataset_01_volume_1_mask_2": 2,
	"dataset_01_volume_2_mask_1": 3,
	"dataset_02_volume_1_mask_1": 4
}
```

# Demo

Demo Project [72.9 MB] [Download](https://github.com/supervisely-ecosystem/import-volumes-with-masks/releases/download/v1.0.2/Volume_Project_with_Masks_demo.tar)

The demo project contains 1 dataset `dataset_01` with 2 volumes.

The first volume has 2 masks `.nrrd` files where each contains 1 object - `lung_1` and `lung_2`

The second volume has 1 mask `.nrrd` file with a `brain` object.



After uploading this project should look like this:

1. Volume with `lung_1` and `lung_2` objects.

2. Volume with `brain` object.
